# Basic Programming Project
## Assignment - "Football Championship"
To write a computer program implementing an information system that supports soccer
championship (Registration number, Team name, Year of foundation, list of matches played). The program
stores and processes data about participating teams and played matches. There are 3 participants in the championship
until 5.
## Basic task – Difficulty Low
- Menu for selecting the functions in the program. (week 7)
- Adding participants to the championship (week 7-8)
	- Add a participant (Name and city);
	- Adding a list of participants. An integer n is entered followed by n of the number of participants.
- Bringing all teams from the championship to the screen (week 8-9).
	- Output teams with the earliest year of foundation
	- Bringing out the teams with the fewest losses

## Addendum One - Difficulty Medium (+ Basic Task)
- Holding the championship (week 10-11)
	- All teams meet each other in swapped away games, randomly generated
the result of the match and is recorded in a list of matches played for the two participating teams;
	- A table with the played matches and results is displayed.

## Supplement Two - Difficulty High (+ Base Task + Supplement One)

- Search for teams in the championship: (week 9-10)
	- Displaying the team with all played matches by entered team name;
	- Displaying the results of the matches played for two teams, by entered names;

## Supplement Three – Difficulty High (+ Base Task + Supplement One + Supplement Two)

- References for the participants teams with sub menu (11-12 weeks)
	- Display all participants in order by:
		- Year of foundation of the team;
		- Points earned.
	- Output of the team that scored the most hits;
		- Bringing out the team with the best goal difference.
- The data in the program can be saved in a file between two starts of the program.

## Supplement Four – (for extra points)
- Additional conditions:
	- When adding a new participant, give the option of choosing whether to enter a new one
or interrupt input.
	- To realize the display of the teams in tabular form (Name of the team, scored
goals, goals conceded, points and games played with a result).
	- To save the data to a binary file.

## Run the program (.exe file)
Path to the program's .exe file:
> ..\FootballChampionship\Debug\FootballChampionship.exe

Path to text file (Appendix Three):
> ..FootballChampionship\Debug\footballMatches.txt

Path to the program binary (Appendix Four):
> ..FootballChampionship\Debug\footballMatches.dat
